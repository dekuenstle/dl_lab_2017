\section{Introduction}


How well does your agent perform from the local view ?

What happens if you increase the history length for the views or make the
view larger ?

\section{Generalization}
\subsection{Target location}
What happens if you change the target location after training (you can
change it in utils.py) ?

\subsection{Map}
What happens if you change the map after training (how well does your
agent generalize) ?

\subsection{Proposal}
Can you think of ways to make the agent generalize across target locations
different maps ? For bonus points: test one of these ideas.
